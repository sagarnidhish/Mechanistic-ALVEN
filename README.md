# Mechanistic-ALVEN

Sparse machine learning methods have been developed in recent years for learning algebraic relationships between input and output data. The most computationally efficient of the methods first construct features from the input data and then solve a convex quadratic program with 1- and 2-norm penalty functions which automatically select the features most useful for predicting the output while being numerically well-posed, even when the number of observations is smaller than the number of features. Here we extend a systematic method for algebraic learning to incorporate any known mechanistic information, which can be qualitative or quantitative. The mechanistic modeling equations are appended to the optimization objective as additional penalty functions. Algorithms for solving this potentially nonconvex program are described, implemented, and used to construct hybrid mechanistic-machine learning models in case studies. The approach is seen to be effective in building predictive models for chemical processes that have a wide variety of nonlinear dynamics and types of mechanistic information.
